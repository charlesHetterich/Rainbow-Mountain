# Rainbow Mountain 
######November 2013 - January 2014
 
Rainbow mountain was my first game. Before I started, I had a couple weeks of experience with console programs and I followed a tutoral on how to set up SDL with some basic functionality. I wanted to create something of my own, and practice what I knew so far in C++. This project was very helpful in teaching me how to manipulate the amount of C++ that I knew at the time. Everything in this game is basically a collage of ideas that I wanted to try out.

I eventually stopped working on this project because it became increasingly difficult to add new enemies and weapons since my code from the start was pretty poorly written. The only weapon that can hurt every enemy is the missle, and there are entire classes that arent at all implemented into the game. I felt that I had improved a lot and I wanted to start something fresh that I could hopefully make more maintainable.
